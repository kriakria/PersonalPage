# You cannot be creative, you can only do creative!
Creativity is not an adjective one can hold for life. Quite the opposite. It is a verb and an adverb. Something you do and/or the way you do things. 

Which makes it interesting to think that we can be vastly creative in some circumstances but not necessarily all. 

We can be creative now, not necessarily later.
